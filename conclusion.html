<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>What can we gather from these scatterplots?</br>
Based on the direction of the dots for all three countries, there is a logarithmic positive correlation between price and ranking,</br>
i.e., the greater the price, the higher the ranking, but after a certain threshold price for each country, rankings plateau.</br>
<div align="left">
<b>Italy: </b>
<ul> 
  <li>The most expensive wine is also the highest ranked.</li>
  <li>Nebbiolo wines tend to have both the lowest and highest rankings.</li>
  <li>The cheapest wine is also the lowest ranked (Pinot Noir).</li>
</ul>
<b>France: </b>
<ul>
  <li>Both the most expensive and highest ranked wines are of variety Chardonnay, but from different wineries.</li>
  <li>The lowest ranked wine is a Zinfandel.</li>
  <li>The cheapest wine is also a Chardonnay.</li>
</ul>
<b>The United States:</b>
<ul>
  <li>The most expensive wines are Cabernet Sauvignons in the US.</li>
  <li>The lowest ranked wine is a Zinfandel, just like France.</li>
