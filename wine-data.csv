988,United States,"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol.

990,United States,"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished.

992,France,"Made from Fer Servadou, Duras and Syrah, this is a wine with a truly local pedigree and a modern style, with prominent new wood.

993,France,"A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay.

995,Italy,"Edèlmio is a sophisticated and toasty blend of Carricante and Chardonnay with fragrant aromas of stone fruit, peach, mineral, almond and freshly chopped pear.

998,United States,"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion.
